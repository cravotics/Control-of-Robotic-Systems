# ENPM 667 Control of Robotic Systems Project 2

## Design and Simulation of LQR and LQG Controllers

This repository holds the project work for the ENPM 667 Control of Robotic Systems course at the University of Maryland, College Park. The project focuses on the design and simulation of Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controllers for a crane system with two masses.

### Project Structure
Each chapter in the report represents a significant component in the system analysis and controller design:

- **Chapter 1** outlines the process of deriving the equations of motion.
- **Chapter 2** details the linearization of the crane's dynamic model.
- **Chapter 3** discusses the conditions under which the system remains controllable.
- **Chapter 4** presents the design and simulation results of the LQR controller.
- **Chapter 5** analyzes the observability of the system.
- **Chapter 6** introduces the Luenberger observer design and its simulation.
- **Chapter 7** concludes with the LQG controller design, simulation, and discussion on handling constant force disturbances.

### Simulations
Simulations were carried out using MATLAB to verify the controller performances and system responses. The code used for the simulations is included in the Appendix.
